Please describe the buildings you created in this file 08-06-01.txt

Explain how you made the buildings. 

1. Building with a  ferrisWheel roof (top right corner)

Firstly, I made a house without roof by simple using BoxGeometry.
Then I use BufferGeometry with determined vertices and uvs to make the roof with a texture.
The texture is something like red heart which makes the building romantic.
Finally, I made a ferris wheel on the top of the roof, which people can go to take it.

I think the shape is complex enough for this building.


2.  Building with a rotating globe (top left corner)

Firstly, I made a house without roof by simple using BoxGeometry.
Then I make a rotating globe with a base and a supporter for a rotating globe.
For the texture, I use world map texture on the rotating globe and starry sky for 
    some sides of the building.

I think the building shape is complex enough and tecture is fancy and has a Astronomy topic.

3. Building with a lifting roof (bottom right corner)

Firstly, I made a house without roof by making five walls and Marvel textures.
Then I made four lifting sticks with a gazebo roof with a Marvel texture.
Finally, I made the roof to go up and down.

I think the building shape is complex enough and tecture is fancy and has a Marvel topic
